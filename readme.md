## description:
The program starts by asking the Reality Realty agent for the name of the file that contains their
database of homes. The file is tab delimited and list information about multiple properties. Each
home begins with a line that lists the home's id number, address, city, state, zip, number of bedrooms, number
of bathrooms, price, and description. The next lines, each of which are indented by one tab, specify the
names and dimensions of the rooms, with the name, width, and length of each room separated by tabs.
The next home in the file begins at the next line that does not begin with a tab. The file is included and
is called homes.txt.
